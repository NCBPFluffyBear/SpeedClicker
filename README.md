To Download: Go to releases (https://github.com/NCBPFluffyBear/SpeedClicker/releases) and click SpeedClicker.exe to download (Chrome may claim that it is unsafe- click the arrow on the download and allow it. Windows Smartscreen may also detect it as unsafe, so click Run Anyway. I won't hack you I promise. I think I have to add a publisher name which I don't know how to do nor want to do.). It is recommended that you move it to desktop. Open SpeedClicker.exe to get started!
## Keyboard Controls:
- Toggle LMB SpeedClicker: `Left Shift` + Backtick ( \` )
- Toggle LMB SpeedClicker: `Left Ctrl` + Backtick ( \` )
- Use LMB SpeedClicker after it is toggled: `Left Alt` + `LMB`
- Use RMB SpeedClicker after it is toggled: `Left Alt` + `RMB`
- Exit SpeedClicker: `Left Alt` + Backtick ( \` )

## Usage:
- Once enabled, holding `Left Alt` + `LMB`/`RMB` will automatically click
- Once disabled, mouse functions will return to normal
- Once exited, the program will end and will have to be relaunched in order to be used

## Other Notes:
- After the `Left Alt` + `LMB`/`RMB` Combination is used, the SpeedClicker will continue to click until `Left Alt` is released
- Setting the C/ms speed to 0 will max the click speed at 60.0 CPS, but this may cause lag.
